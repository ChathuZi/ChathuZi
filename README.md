### Hi there, I'm Sudeshinie Wadigawage! 👋

👀 I'm currently immersed in full-stack web development, leveraging Java technologies such as JSP and Spring Boot, along with frontend frameworks like React and Angular.

🌱 I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science (Hons) degree in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at the University of Wolverhampton.

💞️ While I started as a novice in full-stack software development, my focus has now shifted towards the captivating realms of Data Science, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence. I'm deeply intrigued by their transformative potential in the evolution of technology. While I continue to refine my full-stack skills, my true passion lies at the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and big data.
